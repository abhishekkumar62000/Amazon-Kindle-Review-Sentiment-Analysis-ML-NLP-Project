## 🎯 Project Overview  
🌟 Today, I built a new project called **Amazon-Kindle-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-ML-NLP-Project**! This project leverages **Python** and its libraries to analyze Kindle reviews, perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, apply **Feature Engineering**, and develop a **Machine Learning Model** to classify sentiments effectively.  

---

## 🚀 Key Features  

### 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- 🔍 Analyzed the distribution of review sentiments (positive/negative).  
- 📈 Visualized patterns in the review text.  
- 🧐 Identified trends like most common words and review length impact.  

### 🛠️ **Feature Engineering**  
- ✂️ Cleaned and preprocessed text data (removal of stopwords, punctuation, etc.).  
- 🔤 Converted text into numerical representations using techniques like:  
  - Bag of Words (BoW)  
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)  
- ⚙️ Prepared features for machine learning models.  

### 🤖 **Model Building**  
- 📚 Trained and tested multiple NLP-based machine learning models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Random Forest  
- 🎯 Optimized hyperparameters for the best model performance.
